        Now that we've looked at the architecture
      of the internet, let's see how you might
      </p>
      <p>
        connect your personal devices to
        the internet inside your house.
      </p>
      <p>
      Well there are many ways to
      connect to the internet, and
      </p>
      <p>
      most often people connect wirelessly.
      </p>
      <p>
      Let's look at an example of how
      you can connect to the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you live in a city or a town,
      you probably have a coaxial cable for
      </p>
      <p>
      cable Internet, or a phone line if you
      have DSL, running to the outside of
      </p>
      <p>
      your house, that connects you to
      the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you live far out in the country,
      you'll more likely have
      </p>
      <p>
      a dish outside your house, connecting
      you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or
      </p>
      <p>
      you might also use the telephone system.
      </p>
      <p>
      Whether a wire comes straight from
      the ISP hookup outside your house, or
      </p>
      <p>
      it travels over radio
      waves from your roof,
      </p>
      <p>
      the first stop a wire will make once
      inside your house, is at your modem.
      </p>
      <p>
      A modem is what connects the internet
      to your network at home.
      </p>
      <p>
      A few common residential modems are DSL or
